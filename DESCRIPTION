Description: Design/model matrices are useful covariates for regression models
    and and machine learning tasks. R does a good job of handling these for
    you automatically for factors, but extra difficulties present themselves
    when working with dates. Identifying holidays and the days around them
    can be useful along with other interesting features (e.g. first/last
    week of month, weekday, major sports events, months, and interaction
    terms for these). These tasks are unified in designmatrix with the familiar
    R formula syntax.
